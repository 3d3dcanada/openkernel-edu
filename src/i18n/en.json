    "wt_count_s6": "Now the magic: JUMP IF ZERO. Tap (❓)",
    "wt_count_s6_explain": "❓ checks if R0 is zero. If it IS zero, it jumps to a specific line. This is how computers make decisions!",

    "wt_count_s12_explain": "Loops let computers repeat things millions of times per second. Every video game, every website, every app uses loops."
