# Assessment Rubrics 📊

Use these rubrics to grade student projects and labs in EmojiASM.

## Level 1: Basic Operations (Beginner)
| Criteria | Exceeds Expectations | Meets Expectations | Needs Improvement |
|----------|----------------------|--------------------|-------------------|
| **Logic** | Program uses `📥` and `➕/➖` correctly to solve the prompt. | Program runs but result is slightly off. | Program contains syntax errors. |
| **Output** | High-quality use of `🖨️` to show results. | Program prints result. | No output provided. |

## Level 2: Control Flow (Intermediate)
| Criteria | Exceeds Expectations | Meets Expectations | Needs Improvement |
|----------|----------------------|--------------------|-------------------|
| **Loops** | `🔁` loops are nested correctly and terminated with `🛑`. | Loop runs but might have an off-by-one error. | Infinite loop or missing `🛑`. |
| **Conditionals** | `❓` is used effectively for branching logic. | Conditional jump works but logic is convoluted. | Failed to implement branching. |

## Level 3: Architecture Understanding (Advanced)
| Criteria | Exceeds Expectations | Meets Expectations | Needs Improvement |
|----------|----------------------|--------------------|-------------------|
| **Memory** | Efficient use of `💾` and `📥` for data persistence. | Uses memory but could be more efficient. | Only uses registers R0-R7 for all data. |
| **Optimization** | Minimal instructions used to reach the goal. | Program is correct but verbose. | Unnecessary `⏸️` (NOP) or redundant loads. |
