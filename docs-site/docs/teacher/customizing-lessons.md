# Customizing Lessons 🎨

Teachers can adapt OpenKernel EDU to their specific classroom needs.

## Modifying Existing Lessons
The lesson content is stored as JSON in the database. You can modify:
*   **Instruction text:** Change the explanation for different age groups.
*   **Initial code:** Provide more or less boilerplate for students.
*   **Validation:** Change what counts as a "success" (e.g., checking for specific R0 values).

## Creating New Examples
Students can save their own programs and share them. You can use this to:
*   Create **weekly challenges**.
*   Build a **classroom gallery** of interesting emoji programs.

## Feedback welcome
