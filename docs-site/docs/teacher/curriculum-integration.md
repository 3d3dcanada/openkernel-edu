# Integrating OpenKernel EDU into CS101 🏫

OpenKernel EDU is designed to bridge the gap between high-level logic and low-level hardware understanding.

## Why use EmojiASM for CS101?

1. **Lower Cognitive Load:** By replacing cryptic assembly mnemonics (MOV, JNZ, etc.) with familiar emojis, students can focus on the *logic* of execution.
2. **Instant Feedback:** The visual simulator shows memory and registers changing in real-time.
3. **Inclusive by Design:** Students whose first language is not English can learn the same concepts without language barriers.

## Suggested Integration Points

### Module 1: Binary and Logic
*   **Topic:** How computers represent data.
*   **Activity:** Use the Memory Grid to show how numbers are stored in hex/binary.
*   **Emoji:** `📥`, `🖨️`.

### Module 2: Control Flow
*   **Topic:** IF statements and WHILE loops.
*   **Activity:** Implementing a simple counter that stops at 10.
*   **Emoji:** `🔁`, `🛑`, `❓`.

### Module 3: Functions and the Stack
*   **Topic:** Procedural abstraction and memory call stacks.
*   **Activity:** Building a recursive Fibonacci program.
*   **Emoji:** `📞`, `🛑`.

## Classroom Setup
Teachers can deploy OpenKernel EDU in their labs in under 5 minutes. Since it is browser-based, no software installation is required on student machines.
