# Getting Started in 5 Minutes 🚀

Follow this guide to write and run your first emoji assembly program.

## Step 1: Open the Editor
Navigate to [openkernel.edu](https://openkernel.edu) in your browser. You'll see the Emoji Code Editor in the center of the screen.

## Step 2: Write Your First Program
Type the following emojis into the editor:

```emoji-asm
📥 10        # LOAD 10 into R0
➕ 5         # ADD 5 to R0
🖨️           # PRINT R0
⏹️           # HALT
```

## Step 3: Run It!
Click the **Run (▶️)** button. Watch the CPU Registers on the right:
1. `R0` will change to `10`.
2. `R0` will change to `15` after the addition.
3. The Output Console will display `15`.

## Step 4: Step-by-Step Debugging
Click **Reset (🔄)** and then click the **Step (⏭️)** button to see exactly how each instruction changes the system state.

Congratulations! You've just written your first EmojiASM program. 🎉
