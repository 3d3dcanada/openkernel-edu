# Translation Task — i18n Update for v2.0

All 5 non-English translation files need to be updated to match the structure of `src/i18n/en.json`.

## What needs to happen

Each file below needs **all keys from en.json** translated. The existing keys are already translated — only the NEW sections need to be added:

### New sections to add to each file:
- `nav.welcome`, `nav.beginner`, `nav.demos`
- Entire `welcome` section (~20 keys)
- Entire `beginner` section (~60 keys including 3 walkthrough translations)
- Entire `demos` section (~12 keys)

### Files to update:
1. `src/i18n/es.json` (Spanish)
2. `src/i18n/fr.json` (French)
3. `src/i18n/zh.json` (Chinese)
4. `src/i18n/ar.json` (Arabic)
5. `src/i18n/hi.json` (Hindi)

### Reference:
- `src/i18n/en.json` — the complete English file with ALL keys (this is the source of truth)

### Instructions:
1. Read `en.json` for the full key structure
2. For each language file, read the existing content, then write a new version that:
   - Keeps all existing translated keys unchanged
   - Adds all missing keys with proper translations
   - Maintains valid JSON
3. Run `npm run build` to verify
4. Commit and push to GitHub

### Agent output files with full translations (generated but never written):
The translation content was generated by agents. Check the conversation transcript or regenerate from en.json.
